## 1. Purpose and Scope

### Purpose
Define data models, state machines, REST API endpoints, and path optimization algorithms governing Wave Picking, Batch Multi-Tote Picking, and S-Shape Serpentine Route calculation.

### In Scope
- Relational schema for `picking_waves`, `picking_wave_orders`, `picking_batches`, and `picking_batch_items`.
- `WavePickingService`: Wave lifecycle, FEFO allocation triggers, batch partitioning.
- `PickPathRoutingService`: Serpentine coordinate sorting, distance estimation.
- `BatchPickingService`: Pick execution, tote scanning verification, double-entry inventory ledger deduction.
- Handheld Scanner REST API endpoints (`/v1/scanner/batch-picking/*`).
- Filament Admin Resource: `PickingWaveResource`.

### Out of Scope
- Automated robotic automated guided vehicles (AGV) direct CAN-bus dispatch.
- RFID portal hardware tunnels (handled by barcode laser scanners).

## 2. Requirements and Contract

### Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REQ-WAV-01` | Group pending `DeliveryOrder` or `StagingRequest` items into a `PickingWave`. | Generates a unique wave number `WAV-YYYYMMDD-XXXX` with status `DRAFT`. |
| `REQ-WAV-02` | Release a wave to trigger FEFO lot reservations and generate multi-tote batches. | Status transitions to `RELEASED`, lots are reserved, and batches are created with up to 4 orders per batch. |
| `REQ-WAV-03` | S-Shape Pick-Path Optimization algorithm sorts pick items sequentially. | Picks in odd aisles sort rack ascending, even aisles sort rack descending, shelf ascending. |
| `REQ-WAV-04` | Handheld Batch Pick confirmation requires tote scan. | Verifies scanned lot equals reserved lot, scanned bin equals pick bin, and destination tote matches target order. |
| `REQ-WAV-05` | Double-entry inventory movement upon batch pick item completion. | Creates `InventoryMovement` debiting source bin and crediting `BIN-STAGING-OUT` with zero balance discrepancy. |

  ```json
  {
    "batch_item_id": 142,
    "scanned_bin": "A-01-02-B",

## 3. Validation and Error Handling

| Condition | Required Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Wrong bin scanned | Return HTTP 422: `Scanned bin does not match expected pick location [A-01-02-B]`. Trigger high-low warning chime. |
| Wrong lot scanned | Return HTTP 422: `Scanned lot does not match FEFO reserved lot [LOT-XXXX]. Scan designated lot to ensure shelf-life integrity`. |
| Wrong tote scanned | Return HTTP 422: `Scanned tote [TOTE-03] does not match target order tote [TOTE-01]. Item must be deposited into TOTE-01`. |
| Insufficient physical stock in bin | Return HTTP 422 with option to log partial pick and flag item status `SHORT`. |
